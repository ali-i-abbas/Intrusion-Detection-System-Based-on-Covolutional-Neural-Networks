# Implementing an Intrusion Detection System Based on Covolutional Neural Networks

The modern society heavily relies on internet and
computer networks in areas such as commerce,
education, and communication. Attacks on these
networks cost billions of dollars each year. The
traditional methods of intrusion detection in
networks rely on hand crafted rules which require
constant updates due to the rapid development of
new types of attacks on networks. With the
constant growth of networks and the huge
amount of data carried by these networks, the
traditional methods become increasingly
impractical. Machine learning has been used to
automate the detection of network attacks. It has
the ability to learn patterns of intrusion
autonomously and detect them in real time. The
paper “An Intrusion Detection System Based on
Convolutional Neural Network” by Pengju Liu is
a recent example of using Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) in the field of network intrusion
detection. CNN is a relatively new method in this
area of research, and since reproducibility is one
of the main goals of any scientific research, we
reproduced the results of this paper independently
and were able to confirm its validity.
